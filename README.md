## Overview

In this project, I attempt to create a Bing News Analytics Platform. Data is pulled from the Bing API, cleaned in Azure Databricks.Sentiment analysis is then performed using Azure ML. Tableau is then used to visualize the data.

### Data Architecture


If you decide to include this, you should also talk a bit about why you chose the architecture and tools you did for this project.



## Lessons Learned

It's good to reflect on what you learned throughout the process of building this project. Here you might discuss what you would have done differently if you had more time/money/data. Did you end up choosing the right tools or would you try something else next time?
